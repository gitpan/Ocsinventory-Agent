DESCRIPTION

  Ocsinventory-Agent is an agent for ocsinventory NG. It supports Linux,
  Solaris and AIX. *BSD support is in progress. A port to non UNIX system
  is also possible (e.g: Win32).

PREREQUISITES
  
  These modules are needed:
    Digest::MD5
    XML::Simple
    Net::IP
    Proc::Daemon (optional, only for Daemon mode)
    LWP
    Compress::Zlib: needed for OCS server prior 1.02
  On Linux and *BSD (i386, amd64, ia64) dmidecode is required to read the BIOS stats.
  On Linux and *BSD lspci (from the pciutils package) is required to list PCI devices.
  To get the serial number of the screen you will need one of these tools:
   - monitor-get-edid-using-vbe from the monitor-edid package
   - get-edid from the read-edid package


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

  You can also run the agent from the tarball directory.

  The agent needs some directories to store internal settings.
  mkdir -p /etc/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/lib/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/log/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/run

  you can choose other directories by changing the default settings
  directly in the ocsinventory-agent file.

  You need to launch the agent with root privilege. For debugging you can
  try to launch it with the -l flag:
  eg: ocsinventory-agent -l /tmp --debug


NOTE
 
 Solaris:
  Sun Studio seems to be needed to build the dependency.
