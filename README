DESCRIPTION

  Ocsinventory-Agent is an agent for ocsinventory NG. It supports Linux,
  Solaris and AIX. *BSD support is in progress. A port to non UNIX system
  is also possible (e.g: Win32).

PREREQUISITES

  Perl 5.8. You can try the old linux_agent 1.01 if you still use Perl 5.6 on Linux)
  Those modules are needed:
    Digest::MD5

    XML::Simple

    Net::IP: optional, it is only needed to compute the network information

    LWP

    dmidecode on Linux and *BSD (i386, amd64, ia64) dmidecode is required to read the BIOS stats.

    lspci on Linux and *BSD (pciutils package) is required to list PCI devices.

    Mac::SysProfile on MacOSX to collect the device informations.

    sneep on Solaris/sparc, you must install sneep and record the Serial Number with it :
                  (download it from http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=4304155a)

 
   Those modules are optional

    Proc::Daemon Daemon mode

    Proc::PID::File brings the pid file support if Proc::Daemon is installed

    ipmitoolif you want to collect information about IPMI

    Compress::Zlib needed for OCS server prior 1.02

    To get the serial number of the screen you will need one of these tools:
      - monitor-edid from Mandriva is needed to fetch the monitor. A package is avalaible
        in Fedora repository.
        information http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Tools/monitor-edid
      - get-edid from the read-edid package

BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

  You can also run the agent from the tarball directory.

  The agent needs some directories to store internal settings.

   mkdir -p /etc/ocsinventory-agent
   mkdir -p /var/lib/ocsinventory-agent
   mkdir -p /var/log/ocsinventory-agent
   mkdir -p /var/run

  you can choose other directories by changing the default settings
  directly in the ocsinventory-agent file.

  You need to launch the agent with root privilege. For debugging you can
  try to launch it with the -l flag:
  eg: ocsinventory-agent -l /tmp --debug

  It's also possible to run directly from the tarball directory:

   sudo ./ocsinventory-agent --devlib --server http://foo/ocsinventory 


NOTE
 
 Solaris:
  Sun Studio seems to be needed to build the dependency.
  The generated Makefile needs gmake to be exectuted
  The default installation will install the binary in /usr/perl5/5.XXXXX/bin,
  set you $PATH variable according to that.

 Crontab:
  If you use the crontab to launch the agent you'll probably have to redefine
  the PATH. For example, just add something like:
  PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
  At the begining of the cron file.


SVN
You can prepare a tarball from the SVN devel branch with those commands:
   svn co https://ocsinventory.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ocsinventory/trunk/unified_unix_agent
   cd unified_unix_agent
   perl Makefile.PL
   make manifest
   make dist
